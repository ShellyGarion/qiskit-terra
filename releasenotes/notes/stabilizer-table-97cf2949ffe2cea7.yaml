    Adds ``StabilizerTable`` class. This is a subclass of the ``PauliTable``
    class which includes a boolean phase vector along with the Pauli table
    symplectic array. This represents a list of Stabilizer operators which
    are real-Pauli operators with +1 or -1 coefficient. Because the stabilizer
    matrices are real the ``"Y"`` label matrix is defined as
    ``[[0, 1], [-1, 0]]``. See the API documentation for additional information.
